Dear Applicant,

Thanks for applying to OpenCon 2015! Please take a moment to let others know you’ve applied for OpenCon on Twitter, and share the application form with your friends: http://bit.ly/AttendOpenCon

There are many ways you can get involved in the OpenCon community right away. We host monthly community calls, webcasts, and a discussion forum. These are great ways to connect with others interested in Open Access, Open Education, and Open Data. The OpenCon community is open to anyone—not just those who have attended the main conference or a satellite event. You can join in the community at http://OpenCon2015.org/community

OpenCon 2015 in Brussels is just the start. We hope to partner with many individuals and organizations to host OpenCon satellite events around the world. Last year, our partners—people just like you—brought together hundreds of students and early career researchers across nine countries on five continents through OpenCon satellite events. This year, we hope you’ll consider helping us bring OpenCon to people in your community! To find out more and register your interest in hosting a satellite event, head to http://OpenCon2015.org/satellite

If you’d like to know more about what to expect from OpenCon, you can check out our high quality recordings from the conference last year and follow us on Facebook and Twitter. Please see http://bit.ly/OpenCon2014Playlist and the links below.

You can expect to receive a decision about your application on the 21st of July or earlier. For updates about the application process, be sure to watch the OpenCon Blog at http://OpenCon2015.org/blog

If you have questions about your application, please visit our FAQ: http://OpenCon2015.org/apply/faq

Together, we can build a conference and, more importantly, a community that makes a difference on Open Access, Open Education and Open Data. We appreciate your interest and can’t wait to see you, whether that’s at the main conference, a satellite event, or in the community.

Sincerely,
Nick Shockey and Joe McArthur
On Behalf of the OpenCon Organizing Committee
