<p>Dear Applicant,</p>

<p>Thanks for applying to OpenCon 2015! Please take a moment to let others know you’ve applied for OpenCon on Twitter, or share the <a href="http://bit.ly/AttendOpenCon">application form</a> with your friends.</p>

<p>Before OpenCon, we hope you’ll consider getting involved in the <a href="http://opencon2015.org/community/">OpenCon community</a>. We currently host monthly <a href="http://opencon2015.org/community/calls">Community Calls</a>, a <a href="http://opencon2015.org/community/webcasts">webcast</a> series, and a <a href="http://opencon2015.org/community/discussion">discussion</a> forum. These are great ways to connect with others interested in Open Access, Open Education, and Open Data. The OpenCon community is open to anyone—not just those who have attended the main conference or a satellite event.</p>

<p>If you’re excited about OpenCon, you can play a key part in making it a success. OpenCon 2015 in Brussels is just the start. We hope to partner with many individuals and organizations to host OpenCon satellite events around the world. Last year, our partners—people just like you—brought together hundreds of students and early career researchers across nine countries on five continents through OpenCon satellite events. This year, we hope you’ll consider helping us bring OpenCon to people in your country! To find out more and register your interest in hosting a satellite event, head to <a href="OpenCon2015.org/satellite">OpenCon2015.org/satellite</a>.</p>

You can also follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/OpenCon/248498995352726">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/open_con">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Together, we can build a conference and, more importantly, a community that makes a difference. We appreciate your interest and can’t wait to see you, whether that’s at the main conference, a satellite event, or in the community.</p>

<p>You can expect to receive a decision about your application on July 21st. For updates about the application process, be sure to watch the <a href="http://opencon2015.org/blog">OpenCon Blog</a> and also check out our <a href="http://opencon2015.org/apply/faq">FAQ</a> if you have questions.</p>
